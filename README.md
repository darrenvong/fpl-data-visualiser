# FPL Statistics Visualiser

A graphical visualisation on Fantasy Premier League players' various raw statistics such as their weekly point score,
as well as slightly more sophisticated statistics such as the standard deviation of their scores to highlight consistency
as well as allowing easy comparison between players.

This is merely a very basic, stripped down intro - more contents (graph, codes and the lot) coming up soon!
